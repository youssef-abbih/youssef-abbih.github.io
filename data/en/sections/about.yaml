summary: "Hi, I’m Youssef – Python Developer (Backend & Automation)

I specialize in building robust backend systems, automation pipelines, and cloud-native solutions using Python, Django, Docker, and Kubernetes. Over the past few years, I’ve delivered projects that reduced network downtime, streamlined DevOps workflows, and improved reporting processes for enterprise clients.
